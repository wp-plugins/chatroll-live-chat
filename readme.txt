= I get an error similar to "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /.../wp-chatroll.php on line ##" when I try to activate the plugin.  Is your plugin broken? =

No.  This error occurs because the plugin requires PHP 5 and you're running PHP 4. Most hosts offer PHP5 but sometimes you have to enable it in your control panel, through .htaccess, or by asking them.  There may be instructions for your specific host in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Switching_to_PHP5">Switching to PHP5</a> article in the codex.
