No.  This error occurs because the plugin requires PHP 5 and you're running PHP 4. Most hosts offer PHP5 but sometimes you have to enable it in your control panel, through .htaccess, or by asking them.  There may be instructions for your specific host in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Switching_to_PHP5">Switching to PHP5</a> article in the codex.
