== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use more than one Chatroll widget in my site? =

Yes, you can add as many Chatroll widgets as you want to your sidebar, posts, and pages.

= I get an error similar to "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /.../wp-chatroll.php on line ##" when I try to activate the plugin.  Is your plugin broken? =

No.  This error occurs because the plugin requires PHP 5 and you're running PHP 4. Most hosts offer PHP5 but sometimes you have to enable it in your control panel, through .htaccess, or by asking them.  There may be instructions for your specific host in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Switching_to_PHP5">Switching to PHP5</a> article in the codex.

= How can I add a Chatroll widget to a post or page? =

Use the 'chatroll' shortcode to embed the Chatroll widget into a post or page.
You can easily generate a shortcode by going to your Chatroll's Settings page.
